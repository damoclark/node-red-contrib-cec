   <p>Output node that receives CEC commands to send on the HDMI bus.</p>
   <h3>Input Node Format</h3>
   <p>Commands to send should be specified in the <code>msg</code> <code>payload</code>
   property as an array of objects or if only a single command, then no array,
   just an object.  As an example, the object should have the following properties/values:</p>
   <pre>
{
  "source": "RECORDINGDEVICE1",
  "target": "TV",
  "opcode": "IMAGE_VIEW_ON",
  "args": []
}</pre>
	<p>The above example is a message from recording device 1 (logical address 1) to the
	TV device (logical address 0), to request that it power on, using opcode
	<code>IMAGE_VIEW_ON</code> (hex code 0x04, decimal 4).  No arguments are required for this opcode, hence an empty array.</p>
	<p>This same message could also be expressed with the following same commands:</p>
	<pre>
{
  "source": "recordingdevice1",
  "target": "tv",
  "OPCODE": "image_view_on"
}
	</pre>
	<pre>
{
  "source": "0x1",
  "target": "0x0",
  "opcode": "0x4"
}
	</pre>
	<pre>
{
  "source": 1,
  "target": 0,
  "opcode": 4
}
	</pre>
	<p>As you can see, case is unimportant and you can also use numeric values for the codes,
	and string represenations in hexadecimal (e.g. "0x"). If no args are necessary for the
	opcode, then that property can be omitted. If you wish to use the logical source address assigned
	to your cec adapter, then source can be set as null or simply omitted</p>
	<h3>All Commands</h3>
	<p>See below for a full list of all the codes. Mouse-over for an explanation of their function (reproduced from
	<a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@senzil/cec-monitor">cec-monitor</a>). My sincere thanks to Pablo Gonzalez
	for his work on cec-monitor, without which, node-red-contrib-cec would not be possible.</p>
	<p>Also refer to <a href="http://www.cec-o-matic.com/">cec-o-matic</a> for further information on these
	commands and their usage.</p>
